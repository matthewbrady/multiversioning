/*
 *  Input Queue
 *
 *    Input Queue for all of the actions in the system. The actions are passed
 *    on to the scheduling threads in round-robbin manner. Notice that this means
 *    that the ordering of scheduling threads does not change (i+1 st thread will
 *    get a batch of actions after ith thread. Always.)
 *
 *    The input queue is a one-producer, one-consumer MS queue. The implementation
 *    makes sure that only one scheduler may dequeue transactions at any point in time.
 *    Enqueueing is done by the simulation framework, which ensures that only one thread
 *    enqueues at a time.
