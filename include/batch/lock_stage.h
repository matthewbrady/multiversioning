/*
 *  LockStage
 *    Logically, lockstage corresponds to a set of transactions that can run concurrently
 *    on a given record with no inconsistencies resulting. Hence, if an exclusive lock
 *    is requested, only one transaction may be within a lock stage. However, with a 
 *    shared lock being requested, any number of transactions may be a part of a lock stage.
 *
 *    A lock stage is considered nearly immutable after it has been handed off by a scheduling thread.
 *    The only field that may be updated is the holders integer, which is handled using FAI/FAD
 *    instructions. 
 *
 *    Lock stages form a singly linked list. Moving towards the "next_stage" means moving deeper into
 *    the dependency graph. This would likely be done to pass on a lock.
