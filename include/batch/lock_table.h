// LockTable
//    
//    LockTable is very similar to the traditional lock table in locked systems. It 
//    contains lock stage queues (LockQueues) for every record in the database. The only
//    way to add elements to lock table is to merge in a BatchLockTable which represents
//    transaction schedule of a batch.
//
//    Currently we only allow a single scheduling thread to merge a BatchLockTable into
//    a LockTable and a scheduling thread will block within merge_batch_table until
//    it is able to merge. 
//
//    TODO: this behavior may be changed to (for instance) add
//    the BLTs to a queue. Then, a thread does not exit merge_batch_table until said
//    queue is empty and all the other scheduling threads may continue working on schedules.
//    This should only be done after we have seen that this reduced throughput by a lot.

// BatchLockTable
//
//    BatchLockTable is very similar to the global LockTable, however it only contains

//    only every operated on by a single thread, hence it is non-concurrent. 
//
//    BatchLockTables are used by scheduling threads for creating tables that may be
//    easily merged into the global LockTable.
